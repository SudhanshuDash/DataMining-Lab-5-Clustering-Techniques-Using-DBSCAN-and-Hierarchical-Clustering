# MSCS 634 - Lab 5: Clustering Techniques Using DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering

## Overview
This repository contains Lab 5 for the course MSCS 634 – Advanced Big Data & Data Mining. 
The lab explores clustering techniques using Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN on the Wine dataset from the sklearn library.

The objective of this lab is to understand how different clustering algorithms behave, how parameter selection influences cluster formation, and how to evaluate clustering quality using relevant metrics.

## Files Included

- Lab5_DBSCAN_Hierarchical_Wine.ipynb  
  Jupyter Notebook containing complete implementation, visualizations, and clustering analysis.

- Lab5_Clustering_Explanation.docx  
  Detailed written explanation covering methodology, insights, and challenges encountered.

## Techniques Implemented

- Data Standardization using StandardScaler  
- Dimensionality Reduction using PCA  
- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering  
- DBSCAN Clustering  
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Silhouette Score
  - Homogeneity Score
  - Completeness Score

## Key Learnings

- The importance of feature scaling before clustering
- Visual interpretation of clusters using PCA
- The impact of parameters on DBSCAN performance
- Strengths and limitations of each clustering technique
- The role of evaluation metrics in validating results

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce all outputs and visualizations.
